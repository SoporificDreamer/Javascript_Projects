## This is just a plain Readme..

1. In the .gitignore I have excluded the node_modules, what this means is:
2. The necessary packages to run the program i.e. cheerio, express and request are missing,
3. So what to do is after pulling the code just go to terminal and run npm install in the Webscraper folder,
4. Why? This is because package.json contains the information of the dependancies
